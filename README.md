# 📅 DSA Timetable Generator

A **full-stack project** that applies **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to generate optimized academic timetables.  
The **Python backend** handles scheduling using algorithmic logic to prevent clashes between teachers, subjects, and time slots.  
The **React frontend** provides an intuitive UI for students and admins to interact with and view generated timetables dynamically.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📌 **Automatic Timetable Generation** – Allocates subjects, teachers, and slots without conflicts.  
- ⚡ **DSA in Action** – Uses algorithms like backtracking and greedy methods for scheduling optimization.  
- 🎨 **Frontend (React)** – Interactive interface to input requirements and view timetables.  
- 🛠️ **Backend (Python)** – API-based system to handle scheduling logic.  
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Integration** – Seamless communication between frontend and backend.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask / FastAPI – depending on `main.py`)  
- **Frontend**: React.js + TailwindCSS  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
